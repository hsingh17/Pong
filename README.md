# Pong
Simple recreation of Pong using Pygame

# Motivation
I simply wanted to recreate a retro arcade game in Python with Pygame.

# Installation
## Python3
First, we must install Python3.

`$ sudo apt-get update`

`$ sudo apt-get install python3.6`

For Windows, use the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

## PyGame
Now, we must install PyGame through PIP. If you already have PyGame installed skip this step.

`$ sudo apt install python3-pip`

`$ pip3 install pygame`


Or you could use the [PyGame website](https://www.pygame.org/news)

## Custom Font
I have used a custom font that is available in the repository. If you do not want to install the custom font, you can change the font through the provided source code. 

# Playing
To play, you can use either `$ python3 Pong.py`, or:

`$ chmod +x Pong.py`

`$ ./Pong.py`

The controls are the following:

1. Up and down arrow keys for the right paddle
2. `W` and `S` for the right paddle
3. `Q` to exit
4. `R` to restart

The game goes till one player gets 10 points
