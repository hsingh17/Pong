# Pong
Simple recreation of Pong using Pygame

-No physics was used for ball movement, will most likely come back and do that to create a more authentic experience.
-Used a custom font which can be downloaded from http://www.mattlag.com/bitfonts/
-Will come back to this code, sometime, and clean it up
